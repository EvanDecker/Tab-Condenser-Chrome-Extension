// MVP
  // grab every tab and condense them by url into groups


// stretch features
  // when the groups are formed, they are closed --DONE
  // toggle to decide if pinned tabs are grouped or not
  // user could designate requisite number of open tabs of one url to be eligible for condensing

  // user could designate which urls to be condensed
  // within the popup, have a list of all the current groups (with optional link to it)
  // remove the .com from the hostname in popup.js





  
// ??? probably outside of our scope
// we need a way to sort by url instead of title
// each Tab object has a .url property that we can use for this
// may need to create smaller arrays from the bigger array

// const collator = new Intl.Collator();

// tabs.sort((a, b) => collator.compare(a.title, b.title));
